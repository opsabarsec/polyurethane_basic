# polyurethane basic stoichiometry

This notebook illustrates some basic calculations for polyurethane chemistry.
For undergraduate students of Chemistry, it provides only a simple base
This document should be further elaborated for real formulations, where more reactants are added such as chain extenders or water when making polyurethane foams.

Rather than calculating by hand or adding formulas to Excel, Jupyter notebooks provide clear results from equations and the possibility to add explanation text making the whole calculation more understandable.
The whole code was produced using Google Colabs and can be run without installing any software on your PC.
